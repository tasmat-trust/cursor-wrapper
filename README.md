# Cursor rules for Hexagons

This repo exists as a wrapper for the frontend and backend repos. 

Coding assistants like Cursor work better with as much context as possible. 

Rather than migrate the Hexagons client and backend into a monorepo, this repo represents a folder to open in Cursor, with the frontend and backend living inside it via git submodules.
